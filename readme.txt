This is just an offline viewer and randomizer (and downloader) for Dinosaur Comics:

and inspired by Dadasaurus:

Just adding a little control to the random fun of Dadasaurus with some Python.

This is completely unauthorized, and if Mr. North disapproves then I will promptly take it down.

It's a WX app, and depends on numpy and PIL.

I built 2 apps with Py2App (which usually don't end up working in my experience):
If you have Snow Leopard, get the regular one, it's tiny.
If you have an older system, I made a 'pre SL' version, which is built against python2.5 and includes wx in the bundle, so it's bigger.

Of course, since it's Python and WX, it will run on anything as long as you have Python, wxPython, PIL, and numpy installed. just run 'dinoapp.py' and it should* work.

*should being the operative word.  I haven't tested it on Windows, and don't really care to, but it certainly works fine on Mac/*ix systems.
